These are a bunch of Zabbix templates i have either found on the internet and adapted for use or written by expanding the default templates.

Where possible i'll try and credit the original creators of the various templates, if you see a credit thats missing please just open a GitHub Issue and i will fix.

I've attempted to give instructions where neccesary such as uploading of scripts etc
